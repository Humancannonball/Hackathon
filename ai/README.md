# AI Module Implementation Plan

This document outlines the detailed plan for implementing the AI components of our drone-based route planning system.

## Dataset Evaluation

| Dataset | Description | Advantages | Limitations | Implementation Difficulty | Suitability |
|---------|-------------|------------|------------|---------------------------|-------------|
| [UAVid Dataset](https://uavid.nl/) | 4K UAV videos with 8 semantic categories (Building, Road, Static car, Tree, Low vegetation, Human, Moving car, Background) | - High resolution<br>- Includes moving objects<br>- Street scene context<br>- Video sequences | - Limited to 8 categories<br>- License restrictions | Medium | ★★★★★ |
| [Aerial Semantic Segmentation Drone Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bulentsiyah/semantic-drone-dataset) | Drone imagery with pixel-level annotations | - Ready for semantic segmentation<br>- Easily accessible via Kaggle | - Limited scene diversity | Low | ★★★★☆ |
| [DOTA](https://captain-whu.github.io/DOTA/dataset.html) | Large-scale dataset for object detection in aerial images | - 15-18 object categories<br>- Oriented bounding box annotations<br>- Multiple versions available | - Focus on object detection, not terrain<br>- Complex annotation format | High | ★★★☆☆ |
| [AID](https://captain-whu.github.io/AID/) | Aerial scene classification dataset | - 30 scene types<br>- Good for terrain classification | - Scene-level labels, not pixel-level | Medium | ★★★☆☆ |

**Recommendation:** Use UAVid as primary dataset for terrain classification and the Kaggle Drone Dataset as supplementary. For specific object detection tasks, incorporate DOTA selectively.

## Model Evaluation

### Object Detection Models

| Model | Description | Inference Speed | Accuracy | Implementation Difficulty | Suitability |
|-------|-------------|----------------|----------|---------------------------|-------------|
| YOLOv8 | Latest YOLO version with improved architecture | Very Fast | High | Low | ★★★★★ |
| EfficientDet | Scalable object detection with EfficientNet backbone | Medium-Fast | High | Medium | ★★★★☆ |
| MobileNet-SSD | Lightweight model designed for mobile deployment | Very Fast | Medium | Low | ★★★★☆ |
| Faster R-CNN | Two-stage detector with region proposals | Slow | Very High | High | ★★☆☆☆ |

### Terrain Classification Models

| Model | Description | Inference Speed | Accuracy | Implementation Difficulty | Suitability |
|-------|-------------|----------------|----------|---------------------------|-------------|
| DeepLabV3+ | SOTA semantic segmentation model | Medium | Very High | Medium | ★★★★★ |
| U-Net | Encoder-decoder architecture with skip connections | Fast | High | Low | ★★★★☆ |
| SegFormer | Transformer-based segmentation model | Medium | Very High | High | ★★★☆☆ |

**Recommendations:**
- **Primary Object Detection:** YOLOv8 (best balance of speed and accuracy)

## Integration Requirements

### Hardware Considerations
- Target deployment hardware specs: [TBD]
- Minimum FPS requirement: 10 FPS
- Maximum latency: 100ms

### Output Format
As specified in the main README, models should output detection results in the following JSON format:
```json
{
  "frame_id": 1234,
  "timestamp": "2023-11-15T14:22:36.123Z",
  "obstacles": [
    {"type": "person", "confidence": 0.92, "x1": 120, "y1": 340, "x2": 180, "y2": 480},
    {"type": "vehicle", "confidence": 0.87, "x1": 250, "y1": 100, "x2": 350, "y2": 200}
  ],
  "terrain": [
    {"type": "pavement", "confidence": 0.95, "polygon": [[0,0], [640,0], [640,120], [0,120]]},
    {"type": "grass", "confidence": 0.88, "polygon": [[100,200], [300,200], [300,400], [100,400]]}
  ]
}
```

## Potential Challenges & Mitigations

1. **Challenge:** Limited training data for specific obstacles
   - **Mitigation:** Implement transfer learning from pre-trained models; use data augmentation

2. **Challenge:** Inference speed on resource-constrained hardware
   - **Mitigation:** Model quantization; consider model pruning; evaluate TensorRT/ONNX Runtime

3. **Challenge:** Varying lighting conditions in drone footage
   - **Mitigation:** Include diverse lighting in training data; implement robust preprocessing

4. **Challenge:** Integration with algorithm module
   - **Mitigation:** Early alignment on I/O formats; regular integration testing
